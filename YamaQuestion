Amazon wants to label its products with tags, which are strings of alphanumeric characters. Each product is associated with a sequence of tags. Edward, an employee in the company has been assigned the task of labelling the products. He has been given a sequence of all tags that could be associated with any product, as well as a sequence of all desired tags for the product that he is labeling. His task is to find the 0-based start and end indices of the shortest continuous subsequence containing all the desired tags for the product, in any order. if more than one minimum continuous subsequence contains all the desired tags, then output the one with smaller start index. 

Implement an algorithm to find the 0-based start index and end indices of the minimum continuous subsequence containing all the desired tags in any order.

Input:
The input to the function/method consists of two arguments. 
targetList, a list of strings representing the desired tags.
available TagList, a list of strings representing the sequence of all available tags. 

Output:
Return a list where the first element is the start index, and the second element is the ending index. If more than one minimum continuous subsequence contains the desired tags then return the one with the smaller start index. If there isn't a match, output a list of length of 1 with content 0.

Note
targetList doesn't contains duplicated tags.
The returned subsequence may include additional tags beyond those in targetList.
The availableTagList may include tags other than those in the targetList, and some tags may be duplicated. targetList and availableTagList consist of only alphanumeric character strings. 

if any of the tags in targetList are missing from availableTagList, then output [0]

Example:
input:
targetList = ["made", "in", "Spain"]
availableTagList = ["made","weather","forecast","says","that","made","rain","in","spain","stays"]
